# Transform data by using the SQL Server Stored Procedure activity in Azure Data Factory
> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of Data Factory service you are using:"]

You use data transformation activities in a Data Factory [pipeline](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) to transform and process raw data into predictions and insights. The Stored Procedure Activity is one of the transformation activities that Data Factory supports. This article builds on the [transform data](transform-data.md) article, which presents a general overview of data transformation and the supported transformation activities in Data Factory.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to version 2 of Data Factory, which is currently in preview. If you are using version 1 of the Data Factory service, which is generally available (GA), see [Stored Procedure Activity in V1](v1/data-factory-stored-proc-activity.md).
> 
> If you are new to Azure Data Factory, read through [Introduction to Azure Data Factory](introduction.md) and do the tutorial: [Tutorial: transform data](tutorial-transform-data-spark-powershell.md) before reading this article. 

You can use the Stored Procedure Activity to invoke a stored procedure in one of the following data stores in your enterprise or on an Azure virtual machine (VM): 

- Azure SQL Database
- Azure SQL Data Warehouse
- SQL Server Database.  If you are using SQL Server, install Self-hosted integration runtime on the same machine that hosts the database or on a separate machine that has access to the database. Self-Hosted integration runtime is a component that connects data sources on-premises/on Azure VM with cloud services in a secure and managed way. See [Self-hosted integration runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md) article for details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When copying data into Azure SQL Database or SQL Server, you can configure the **SqlSink** in copy activity to invoke a stored procedure by using the **sqlWriterStoredProcedureName** property. For details about the property, see following connector articles: [Azure SQL Database](connector-azure-sql-database.md), [SQL Server](connector-sql-server.md). Invoking a stored procedure while copying data into an Azure SQL Data Warehouse by using a copy activity is not supported. But, you can use the stored procedure activity to invoke a stored procedure in a SQL Data Warehouse.

> When copying data from Azure SQL Database or SQL Server or Azure SQL Data Warehouse, you can configure **SqlSource** in copy activity to invoke a stored procedure to read data from the source database by using the **sqlReaderStoredProcedureName** property. For more information, see the following connector articles: [Azure SQL Database](connector-azure-sql-database.md), [SQL Server](connector-sql-server.md), [Azure SQL Data Warehouse](connector-azure-sql-data-warehouse.md)          

 

## Syntax details
Here is the JSON format for defining a Stored Procedure Activity:

```json
{
    "name": "Stored Procedure Activity",
    "description":"Description",
    "type": "SqlServerStoredProcedure",
    "linkedServiceName": {
        "referenceName": "AzureSqlLinkedService",
        "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
    },
    "typeProperties": {
        "storedProcedureName": "sp_sample",
        "storedProcedureParameters": {
            "identifier": { "value": "1", "type": "Int" },
            "stringData": { "value": "str1" }

        }
    }
}
```

The following table describes these JSON properties:

| Property                  | Description                              | Required |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- |
| name                      | Name of the activity                     | Yes      |
| description               | Text describing what the activity is used for | No       |
| type                      | For Stored Procedure Activity, the activity type is **SqlServerStoredProcedure** | Yes      |
| linkedServiceName         | Reference to the **Azure SQL Database** or **Azure SQL Data Warehouse** or **SQL Server** registered as a linked service in Data Factory. To learn about this linked service, see [Compute linked services](compute-linked-services.md) article. | Yes      |
| storedProcedureName       | Specify the name of the stored procedure to invoke. | Yes      |
| storedProcedureParameters | Specify the values for stored procedure parameters. Use `"param1": { "value": "param1Value","type":"param1Type" }` to pass parameter values and their type supported by the data source. If you need to pass null for a parameter, use `"param1": { "value": null }` (all lower case). | No       |
